<center><h2>Hello everyone! I'm currently a sophomore in college who is enrolled in the IDEAS major. This webpage is a viewing of all the projects that i've been assigned to do in my IDEAS 120 class. As difficult and new as these assignments were to me, I hope you enjoy taking a look through my pages filled with all my creative thoughts!</h2></center>

<center><h1><u>Digital Header</h1></u></center>
<center><h2>This was our first class project. My original idea was supposed to be a picture of a dandelion with a simple blue cloud background. However, it ended up eing much more. In addition to the blue cloud background, I added a pink sunset sky backgroung. The pink sunset background remained on the top half of the picture, while the bottom portion remained as the blue cloud picture.</h2></center>

<center><h1><u>Digital Typography</h1></u></center>
<center><h2>This was our second class project. I struggled a great amount considering that I've never been told to makes words LOOK creative, unlike writing and making them SOUND creative. With some help from my professor, Tiffany Funk, she taught and assisted me on how to overlap your words with an image. My digital typography image is the exact same one from my header, but in black and white instead of color.</h2></center>

<center><h1><u>Digital Non-linear Narrative</h1></u></center>
<center><h2>This was our third class project; a twine game! My twine game was based  off of SOME of my real life experiences. It's based off of my trips that I've taken to the Bahamas and Peru. It leads you through your trip which in the end, always becomes a massive disater, similar to how mine have.</h2></center>
